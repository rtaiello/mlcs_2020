# Abstract
The course focuses on the relationship between the possibility of defining an object / problem in a certain logical language and the computational (or algorithmic) complexity of the object / problem itself. <br> 
This theme is illustrated through classical results and techniques and recent developments. First Order logic: syntax and semantics. Elimination of quantifiers, decidable theories. Definability of a query in a logic. <br>
Techniques to demonstrate non-expressibility (Duplicator / Spoiler games, locality). Logical descriptions of computations. Results of algorithmic undecidability. The Calculus of Predicates. Completeness and Compactness. Ultrafilters and ultraproducts. Applications to the definability of queries. GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorems. Logic of provability, modal logic, hints of temporal logic. Kripke semantics. Computation with oracles and Arithmetic Hierarchy. Degrees of algorithmic insolubility. Analysis of the algorithmic content of theorems. Calculation of sequents and cut-elimination.

The homeworks have to be taken with a pinch of salt, these are not **solutions but just my final outcomes**.
